# WS2022_Julia

This is an introduction course into the Julia programming language. You donâ€™t need any prior knowledge in programming to follow this course.  The course is split up into 9 chapters (chapter 10 not finished, yet) which will teach you how to use Julia in Jupyter Notebooks in a scientific context. When you have finished the course you will be able to write custom functions, import data, make beautiful plots, perform data analysis and understand how simulations work in Julia.  
The course is still in a beta state, therefore everybody is very welcome to take a look at it and give us feedback.
