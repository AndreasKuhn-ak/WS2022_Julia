Similarly, with `!=` it is possible to check, whether numbers/variables/.. are not equal. You can also test if a number/variable is smaller/larger than anything else with `<`,`>`,`<=` and `>=`. If you want to check if a certain element is in an array/tuple/set, you can use `in`. These operators can be connected by `&&` and `||` which represent logical `and` and `or`. As a result, you will always get a boolean (`true` or `false`) for all of those operators. "
