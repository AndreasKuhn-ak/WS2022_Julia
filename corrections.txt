Julia_Notebooks
Edit a cell: Not sure what you mean - does not work like that

Short cuts: the reference is a bit dodgy - a lot of advertisement that has to be skipped and a lot of scrolling, maybe better use View->Activate Command Palette 

3. Markdown language:
strictly speakig, the text cell is not called markdown, but the "language" that yo use to write the content
"Line breaks only with the enter key do not work reliable." What do you mean?

the "guess the number" should have a noption of stopping it, if one is not in the mood for guessing

6. Operators:
"Operators in Julia are quite similar to mathematical operators:" - only the last three, not the first three

in Julia, can + also be used fro concatenation, if so, that is not as in mathematics

9. Multi-line statements
<p style='text-align: justify;'> was not in the other text cells, should be consistent for all course noteooks


Package_Install
Description: Maybe a few words about why there are packages and what they are for? Why isn't everything just included?

you are mixing 'using' and installing packages - maybe a word about the difference. Or an introductory sentence of why for the DataFrames, it needs to be installed.
For the installing - do you need internet connection?
