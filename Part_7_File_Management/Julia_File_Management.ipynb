    " Serialization is mainly used in the internals of Julia to exchange objects between different processes/ Julia sessions, ... . Therefore, it is optimized for maximum performance but not necessarily for backwards compatibility. The developers have promised that it will not break between 1.xx versions of Julia, but if at some point a new x.0 version of Julia comes out, there might be issues importing old stored data into the new Julia version.\n",
    "But as the past has shown, even packages, that are focused on long term storage, are not safe from [compatibilty issues](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/jld-jl-vs-jld2-jl/15287). Therefore, we believe that `Serialization` is currently the best and for sure fastest option to save huge junks of data in Julia."

    "Human-readable implies that the exported data can be opened using various programs like text editors, Excel, and more, and can be easily understood by humans. The most common method to achieve this involves converting data into `Strings` and then storing them in a .txt file. Different methods and standards exist for this purpose (`JSON`, `JSON3`, `BSON`, ...), each with its own applications and limitations. While it's generally advisable to avoid such formats due to slower speeds and increased error susceptibility compared to serialization, there are situations where you may need to import data from external sources in textform. If your data conforms to one of the mentioned formats, you can call yourself lucky, install the respective package and import the file with the corresponding import function.
