Further optional arguments are `normalization = :pdf`, which rescales the data to a probability density function and all probabilties sum up to 1.

In `Makie`, the function `boxplot!()` leads to a box-whisker plot. `boxplot()` needs the input data in form of two arrays. One array with the position of the marks on the x-axis for every data point, and one containing the value of every datapoint. Optional keyword arguments can customize the plot. For example, you can make a horizontal box plot with `orientation:horizontal`. More keyword arguments can be found [here](https://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/examples/plotting_functions/boxplot/)."
