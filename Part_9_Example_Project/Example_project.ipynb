    "Two functions are created here, one for a 2D animation and one for a 3D animation. Both need a grouped dataframe as argument together with the gridsize. Both functions return a figure object and a variable called t which represents the timesteps and is an object of type `Observable`. This `Observable` has the special ability, that all objects that depend on it (in this case x,y,r,titel and the figure) are automatically updated when it changes. Therefore, the `run_animation` function for both 2D and 3D is the same and just slowly increases the timesteps t. The plot then automatically updates :).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Compared to other plotting packages like `matplotlib` in Python or `ggplot` in R, this is a very different approach to create animations or videos. The big advantage of the `Observable` based implementation is that you do not have to define a new plot object for every frame, you just need to specify what has changed between frames. Together with the gpu accelaration, this allows a much better performance.  "
